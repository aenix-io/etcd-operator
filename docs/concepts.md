# Concepts

This document explains the operator's design choices and the contracts they create. The goal is to give an operator running etcd clusters a working mental model — enough to predict what the controller will do, debug it when it doesn't, and read the conditions correctly.

The reader is assumed to be k8s-fluent. For deployment steps see [installation](installation.md); for kubectl recipes see [operations](operations.md).

## API model

Two custom resources, one of them user-facing.

**`EtcdCluster`** — the user-facing object. It captures cluster-wide intent: replica count, etcd version, per-member storage size, a progress deadline. This is the only resource users normally touch.

**`EtcdMember`** — one per etcd member. Created and deleted by the cluster controller. Each `EtcdMember` owns its Pod and PVC. Users should not create, edit or **delete** these directly.

Deleting one by hand is not a recoverable mistake: the member's PVC is controller-owned by it, so the data volume is removed with the CR (and on a `Delete`-reclaim StorageClass the data itself), while the member's finalizer removes the member from etcd on the way out. Delete every member of a cluster and it dismembers itself, leaving nothing to restore from. Scale the `EtcdCluster` instead — see [member deletion is denied at admission](#member-deletion-is-denied-at-admission).

There is **no StatefulSet**. Each member's Pod and PVC are reconciled independently by the member controller. The motivation is protocol awareness: scale-up adds a member as a learner first and only promotes once it's caught up; scale-down runs `MemberRemove` via a finalizer before reclaiming the Pod; pod restarts reuse the existing data dir and rejoin with the same etcd-side member ID. None of these flows fit StatefulSet's "all replicas are one fungible workload" model.

The cluster controller decides *which* members exist and orchestrates the etcd-side state machine (`MemberAddAsLearner` / `MemberPromote` / `MemberRemove`). The member controller decides *how* a member becomes real — Pod, PVC, etcd flags — and reports observed facts (member ID, readiness) back up to its CR's status.

## Member deletion is denied at admission

The chart installs a `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` that rejects `DELETE` on `etcdmembers` for everyone except:

- the operator's own ServiceAccount — scale-down and crash-loop replacement delete members deliberately;
- `system:serviceaccount:kube-system:generic-garbage-collector` — a deleted `EtcdCluster` must still cascade to its members;
- `system:serviceaccount:kube-system:namespace-controller` — deleting a namespace must not hang;
- anything listed in `memberDeletionProtection.additionalAllowedUsers`, for platforms whose own controllers legitimately reap these objects.

The rejection message says what would have happened and how to proceed deliberately. Break-glass without uninstalling the policy:

```sh
kubectl annotate etcdmember.etcd-operator.cozystack.io <member> -n <ns> \
  etcd-operator.cozystack.io/allow-deletion=true
kubectl delete etcdmember.etcd-operator.cozystack.io <member> -n <ns>
```

The guard exists because the accident it prevents is unrecoverable and easy: one `kubectl delete`, a GitOps prune of an unexpected object, a cleanup script sweeping CRs by label. The controllers cannot make that survivable — a member's data volume is bound to its identity, and a replacement member gets a fresh name and UID — so the event is stopped at the boundary instead.

Requires Kubernetes 1.30+ (`ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` GA). On older apiservers, install with `memberDeletionProtection.enabled=false`; the operator behaves as before, without the guard.

**Uninstalling:** remove the policy before removing the CRDs. `helm uninstall` does this in the right order, but a manual teardown that deletes the CRDs first will find member deletion denied and stall.

## Member naming

`EtcdMember` CRs are created with `ObjectMeta.GenerateName="<cluster>-"`. Each member's name is an apiserver-assigned random suffix (e.g. `mycluster-7xq2k`). Names are not predictable, and that is deliberate — the previous design used `<cluster>-<ordinal>` and tied cluster identity to ordinal reuse across incarnations, which is exactly the trap to avoid for stateful systems. Now:

- Deleting an `EtcdCluster` and recreating one with the same name produces fresh member names (different suffixes).
- The `--initial-cluster-token` is derived as `<namespace>-<cluster>-<uid>`, so the token also differs across incarnations.
- Together: two incarnations of "same-named EtcdCluster" never look alike to etcd, to k8s, or to a stale PVC trying to mount itself back into the new cluster.

The seed (the original `EtcdMember` created during bootstrap) carries `spec.bootstrap=true`. That flag is the discovery anchor (see [bootstrap](#bootstrap-and-discovery)) and is otherwise just historical metadata — the seed has no permanent special role in raft and can be removed like any other member.

## Locking pattern

A naive operator re-reads `spec` every reconcile and acts on whatever it sees. That breaks etcd in two well-known ways:

1. **Mid-bootstrap replica change.** Etcd requires every bootstrapping member to start with the same `--initial-cluster` flag. Editing `spec.replicas` mid-bootstrap would have two members agreeing on different cluster shapes; etcd refuses to form.
2. **Scale-up followed immediately by scale-down.** `MemberAdd` registers the new peer with etcd before its pod is Ready. Reverting `spec.replicas` in that window leaves the operator deleting a member it can't yet identify.

Both failures share a root cause: the user's "desired state" mutates on a faster cadence than the operator can converge.

**The fix.** The operator commits to a target. The first time it sees an `EtcdCluster`, it copies the spec into `status.observed` and stamps `status.progressDeadline = now + spec.progressDeadlineSeconds`. From then on the controller reconciles against `status.observed`, not `spec`. Spec changes are *noticed* but not *acted on*; they only get adopted into `observed` when:

- the cluster has reached the current `observed` (the in-flight reconcile finished cleanly), or
- the deadline has elapsed (the in-flight reconcile gave up).

This is the same pattern Deployments use with `progressDeadlineSeconds`, applied at a coarser granularity. The trade-off is responsiveness: a spec edit takes effect on the next "complete" boundary, not immediately. In practice this is exactly the property you want for stateful workloads.

### What "complete" means

`reconciliationComplete` returns true when:

- `status.observed` has been populated (first-reconcile init has happened),
- the number of non-dormant active members equals `observed.replicas`,
- all those members report `MemberReady=True`, and
- if `observed.replicas > 0`, `status.clusterID` is latched.

The `observed.replicas == 0` case relaxes the ClusterID requirement — a paused or fresh-zero cluster has no running etcd process to source one from. Without this relaxation, a fresh-zero cluster scaled up to 1 would never complete and the spec-change-adoption path would never fire.

### Deadlines as terminal errors

An expired `ProgressDeadline` is a **terminal error**, not a "try again with the latest spec" signal. The operator stops acting on its own and waits for the user. The shape of "intervention" depends on whether the cluster ever bootstrapped:

- **Before bootstrap finished** (`status.clusterID == ""`): the partial members carry an `--initial-cluster` flag baked into their pod specs. There is no in-place recovery — recovery is to delete the EtcdCluster and recreate. The condition stays `Available=False, Reason=BootstrapFailed`.
- **After bootstrap finished**: the cluster itself is healthy; only the most recent operation got stuck (e.g. a scale-up to a replica count the cluster can't schedule). The user's spec edit is the intervention — when `spec != status.observed`, the operator treats that as "I'm fixing this", snapshots the new spec, sets a fresh deadline, and resumes. Until that edit, the operator sits in `Available=False, Reason=DeadlineExceeded`.

The operator never silently auto-pivots on deadline expiry. Silent recovery is the wrong default for stateful workloads where the failure modes include data divergence.

You can force a deadline by patching `status.progressDeadline` to a past time. This is the documented escalation when a slow reconcile is wedged and the standard 10-minute window hasn't elapsed yet.

## Create-then-Patch

Because each member's `--initial-cluster` flag contains its own name, and that name isn't known until the apiserver fills in `GenerateName`, every member moves through three steps in order:

1. **Create** the `EtcdMember` CR with `GenerateName` and an empty `spec.initialCluster` (for the seed: also `spec.bootstrap=true`).
2. **MemberAddAsLearner** with the assigned name's peer URL. Skipped for the seed; skipped on scale-up if the peer URL is already registered (crash recovery — see below).
3. **Patch** `spec.initialCluster` from etcd's authoritative member list.

The member controller refuses to start a Pod while `spec.initialCluster` is empty, so a transient "pending" CR (between steps 1 and 3) never reaches the data plane.

### Crash recovery

If a reconcile crashes between steps 1 and 2, the next reconcile sees a pending CR with no matching peer URL in etcd, and calls `MemberAddAsLearner` (then completes the patch).

If a reconcile crashes between steps 2 and 3, the next reconcile sees a pending CR whose peer URL is already registered, skips `MemberAddAsLearner`, and completes the patch. This must happen *before* any promotion attempt — the orphan learner cannot sync without its pod, the pod cannot start until `spec.initialCluster` is set, and a promote attempt would block forever on the un-synced learner. The control flow in `scaleUp` orders these steps explicitly.

Operators inspecting a cluster mid-reconcile may see CRs with empty `spec.initialCluster`. That is the intentional transient state, not corruption.

## Bootstrap and discovery

The cluster forms from a single seed member. Multi-seed bootstrap (multiple members agreeing on `--initial-cluster` upfront) is historically the source of the "mid-flight replica change corrupts consensus" bug. Single-seed bootstrap eliminates that class of failure: the seed forms a one-member cluster with itself in `--initial-cluster`, the operator latches `clusterID` once that member is up, and every subsequent member joins via `MemberAddAsLearner`.

**Discovery** is the bridge between "seed pod is up" and "operator knows the cluster ID". The cluster controller calls `MemberList` against the seed's client URL, validates the response (exactly one member, matching the seed's name or peer URL), and latches `status.clusterID`. Once latched, discovery is never run again.

The seed is identified by `spec.bootstrap=true`. Member names being random precludes a name-based lookup, and trusting list order (`members[0]`) silently anchors discovery to the wrong member when scale-up CRs land in front of the seed. Once `clusterID` is set, no *membership* decision re-reads `spec.bootstrap` — the seed is, from that point on, just a regular member. It is not scheduled differently, not weighted in quorum, and not exempt from [crash-loop self-heal](#crash-loop-self-heal). A cluster running with no `spec.bootstrap=true` member at all is a normal, supported state: it is what every cluster adopted by `cmd/etcd-migrate` starts out as, and what any cluster becomes once its seed is replaced.

`spec.bootstrap` is never cleared, so it stays a permanent record of which member formed the cluster. One derivation still consults it: `--initial-cluster-state` uses it to gate *which* member may ever be told to bootstrap, and then narrows that by cluster phase — see [Bootstrap state is a phase, not a member](#bootstrap-state-is-a-phase-not-a-member).

If the seed's pod hasn't been created yet (between Create and Pod-up), the controller surfaces `Progressing=True/WaitingForSeed` rather than dialing a nonexistent endpoint and burning the reconcile budget.

## Scale to zero

`spec.replicas: 0` parks the cluster rather than dismantling it.

### Pause (1→0)

When the cluster controller's `scaleDown` observes `desired==0 && len(running)==1`, it Patches `spec.dormant=true` on the surviving member. The CR is **not** deleted. On the next reconcile of that member, the member controller observes `spec.dormant=true` and runs `ensurePodAbsent` — deletes the Pod, clears `status.podName`, surfaces `Ready=False/Paused`. The PVC is not touched. It keeps its existing owner-ref to the `EtcdMember`, which still exists. So nothing reparents, nothing cascade-deletes.

Intermediate steps of a multi-member descent (3→2, 2→1) are normal scale-downs: pick newest, Delete CR, finalizer runs `MemberRemove`. Only the final 1→0 step flips dormant.

### Wake (0→1+)

When the user sets `spec.replicas >= 1`, the cluster controller's spec-change-adoption path snapshots the new spec into `observed`. On the next reconcile, `scaleUp` finds the dormant member and Patches `spec.dormant=false`. No name lookup, no Create, no etcd RPC at this stage. The member controller then runs the normal `ensurePVC` (which finds the existing PVC by UID match and accepts it) + `ensurePod` (which creates the Pod). Etcd resumes from the data dir with the same `ClusterID` and member ID.

Further scale-up proceeds normally via `MemberAddAsLearner` + `MemberPromote`.

### Why "dormant on the member" instead of "delete the CR + reparent the PVC"

An earlier iteration of this feature deleted the CR, reparented the PVC to the `EtcdCluster`, latched the member's name in `status.dormantMember`, and recreated the member by name on resume. Every iteration accumulated edge cases: cross-resource cache races on the pause trigger (Status update visible before Delete event delivery, or vice versa), foreign-CR-by-fixed-name adoption on resurrection, stale status field after a missed update, fresh-zero-vs-dormant message divergence. The redesigned mechanism — pause is a Patch, resume is a Patch, CR is never deleted — removes all those failure modes by construction. The mechanism the operator needs to support is "the EtcdMember CR is preserved across the pause and the user can scale to 0 and back without external coordination". It now is.

### Replica accounting

`current` is computed from `filterRunningMembers(...)` — non-deleted, non-dormant. A dormant member contributes zero capacity, so it must not count against `desired`, otherwise:

- A 1-member cluster paused at replicas=0 would look like "we have 1 member, target is 0" and the cluster controller would try to scale down again, finding nothing valid to do.
- Scaling a paused cluster back up to >=1 would never decide to wake the dormant member because `current==desired` would already be satisfied.

The single exception is the steady-state call to `updateStatus`, which receives the full active set (including dormant). `updateStatus`'s Paused branch uses `findDormantMember(members)` to name the parked PVC in the `Available=False/Paused` message. Stripping the dormant member at that call site would silently fall back to the fresh-zero "no data has been written" message even on real dormant clusters. The asymmetry is deliberate and the call site is commented.

## Storage

Each member's data dir is configured via `spec.storage`, a struct with `size`, `medium`, and an optional `storageClassName`. The medium chooses between a PVC and a tmpfs `emptyDir`; the locking pattern protects size and medium just like `replicas` and `version` — a mid-flight flip is locked out until the current target is reached or the deadline expires.

| `spec.storage.medium` | Backend | Lifetime | Pod loss → |
|---|---|---|---|
| `""` (default) | PVC; `spec.storage.storageClassName` if set, else the namespace default; `ReadWriteOnce` | Survives Pod restart, eviction, node failure (re-attached to new Pod). | Same Pod / new Pod re-uses existing data dir; etcd rejoins with the same member ID and `ClusterID`. **Exception:** if the data dir is lost or corrupt so etcd cannot boot and the member crash-loops past the threshold, the operator deletes and replaces it with a *fresh* member ID (quorum-gated) — see [Crash-loop self-heal](#crash-loop-self-heal) below. |
| `"Memory"` | `emptyDir{medium: Memory}` with `sizeLimit: spec.storage.size` | Bound to the Pod. Container restart preserves tmpfs; Pod deletion / eviction / node failure destroys it. | Operator detects Pod loss via recorded `Status.PodUID`, self-deletes the `EtcdMember`, finalizer calls `MemberRemove`, scale-up gap-fill creates a replacement with a fresh member ID. A member whose Pod is *alive* but whose etcd can never start (e.g. a learner baked with a stale `--initial-cluster`) is instead caught by [Crash-loop self-heal](#crash-loop-self-heal). |

`spec.storage.storageClassName` mirrors the corev1 PVC field of the same name: **nil** uses the namespace's default `StorageClass`, the **empty string** explicitly disables dynamic provisioning (a pre-provisioned PV must already match), any other value names a specific `StorageClass`. It's immutable post-create — `PersistentVolumeClaim.spec.storageClassName` is itself immutable, so there is no in-place change a controller could honour without rolling every PVC. Ignored when `medium=Memory` (no PVC is created).

### Why memory-backed is opt-in

It trades durability for speed and isolation from node-level storage. Suits:

- Kubernetes-in-Kubernetes apiservers whose state is GitOps-managed and reconstructable.
- Throwaway test clusters.
- Workloads where etcd is a transient cache, not the system of record.

It is **not** appropriate as a general-purpose etcd backend. A node drain or simultaneous evictions of more-than-quorum members destroys the cluster permanently — there is no data to restart from.

### Pod-loss detection (memory only)

On every reconcile of a memory-backed member the controller stamps `Status.PodUID` with the live Pod's UID. On a subsequent reconcile:

- Pod present, UID matches → steady state.
- Pod absent (or UID differs) with a previously recorded UID → loss confirmed.

The member controller self-deletes the `EtcdMember`. The existing finalizer runs `MemberRemove` against quorum-reachable peers and the Pod / PVC owner-refs handle the rest of GC. The cluster controller's normal `current < desired` arm then scales up: a fresh `EtcdMember` is created with a new `GenerateName` and a new etcd-side member ID. There is no in-place "rejoin with empty data dir" — that path would require lying to raft.

If quorum is already lost across multiple simultaneous failures, `MemberRemove` will fail and the dying members stay in `Terminating` until quorum returns. That is the correct outcome: the cluster is dead and the user has to recreate it. The operator does not try to be clever about restoring a quorum from inconsistent half-states.

`Status.BrokenMembers` stays at 0 in normal operation, including across a memory pod-loss + auto-replacement cycle. The `isBroken` predicate is implemented for memory members (lost-Pod state), but the member controller intercepts the loss and self-deletes the member in the same reconcile pass — by the time the cluster controller computes the count, the lost member is already `Terminating` and excluded from the running set. The field exists as a future hook for broken-member detection policies that don't immediately tear the member down. Crash-loop self-heal (next section) does **not** flow through `isBroken`/`BrokenMembers` — it triggers off the Pod's container restart count directly, so `BrokenMembers` stays 0 across that cycle too.

### Crash-loop self-heal

A member can end up with a Pod that is alive but whose etcd can never start. For a PVC member the classic cause is a data dir lost or corrupt (a volume lost on node failure) while the cluster membership moved on, leaving the member's *frozen* `--initial-cluster` stale — etcd refuses to boot (`error validating peerURLs ... member count is unequal`) and the Pod crash-loops forever. For a memory member the same wedge hits a *replacement learner*: its `--initial-cluster` is baked into the immutable Pod spec at creation, so if membership changes again before its first successful boot, every restart re-fails the same validation. In both cases the Pod itself never dies, so the memory-style `Status.PodUID` loss check never fires — this restart-count trigger is the only recovery path.

The member controller detects this and replaces the member:

- **Trigger.** The etcd container is not ready and has restarted at least `dataLossRestartThreshold` (5) times. `OOMKilled` is excluded (whether it's the current or the last termination) — that's a resource problem re-creating the member would not fix — and a Pod that is itself being deleted (drain/eviction/manual restart) is never treated as stuck.
- **Quorum gate.** The operator deletes the member only when the *rest* of the cluster still has quorum, so a cluster-wide outage (many members crashing at once) never cascades into mass deletion. The count is read from `Status.ReadyMembers`, which the cluster controller maintains and which can lag; if the stuck member is still counted ready, the gate subtracts it. As a second line of defence the finalizer's `MemberRemove` is itself quorum-gated, so even a stale-high count cannot delete data below quorum.
- **No seed exemption.** The trigger is the member's *state*, never its identity, so the bootstrap seed is replaced on the same terms as anyone else. Only the bootstrap *window* needs protecting, and the quorum gate delivers that for free: `updateStatus` does not run until `clusterID` is latched, so `ReadyMembers` is 0 throughout bootstrap and nothing can pass the gate. Phase expires; identity does not.
- **Replacement.** Deleting the `EtcdMember` runs the finalizer's clean `MemberRemove`, any member-owned PVC is GC'd (discarding the corrupt data dir; memory members have none), and the cluster controller gap-fills a fresh `GenerateName` member with a current `--initial-cluster` and a **new** etcd member ID — not a same-ID rejoin.
- **Latency.** `CrashLoopBackOff` caps its backoff at 5 minutes, so reaching 5 restarts takes on the order of **tens of minutes**, not the ~5s of the memory Pod-loss path. A deliberately-deleted-and-replaced member during this window is expected operator behavior, not a fault. A slow restore or slow learner join on the *replacement* can itself trip the threshold and be replaced again; this is quorum-gated and self-limiting, but expect it on a struggling cluster.

### Bootstrap state is a phase, not a member

`--initial-cluster-state` is the one flag that decides whether etcd *forms* a cluster or *joins* one. etcd reads it only when the data dir is empty, which makes it invisible on every ordinary restart and decisive in exactly one situation: a member coming back with nothing on disk.

That makes it a statement about where the cluster is in its life, not merely about which member is which. Identity remains a precondition — only the seed can ever bootstrap — but it is no longer sufficient on its own. `new` requires **all three** of:

- `spec.bootstrap=true`, so a scale-up member is never a candidate under any circumstances;
- the member has never been seen in etcd's member list (`status.memberID` is empty); and
- the cluster has not latched a `status.clusterID`.

The first is a hard identity gate that never expires. The other two are the phase signals, and either of them being set proves the cluster already formed — which makes an empty data dir data loss rather than a pending bootstrap. `=existing` is then correct: etcd fails to start against the stale `--initial-cluster`, the Pod crash-loops, and [self-heal](#crash-loop-self-heal) replaces the member.

Keeping the identity gate matters for a reason the phase signals alone do not cover: the cluster-formed signal is read from the parent `EtcdCluster` and falls back to "not formed" when that read fails, while a scale-up member's `status.memberID` stays empty until its Pod is Ready. Without `spec.bootstrap` a transient API error during that window would hand a scale-up member `=new`.

Deriving it from `spec.bootstrap` instead — a field set once and never cleared — meant the seed carried `new` for the life of the cluster. That is inert on a *corrupt* data dir (etcd fails to boot either way) but not on an **empty** one: `new` against the seed's frozen self-only `--initial-cluster` is a complete, internally consistent bootstrap instruction, so etcd would not error. It would form a fresh one-member cluster on the empty dir, elect itself leader of it, and pass its `/health` readiness probe.

Two consequences follow, and it is worth separating what is certain from what is not.

**Certain: the member goes Ready on an empty data dir.** The readiness probe is `/health`, which a healthy one-member cluster answers 200. `<cluster>-client` selects every member Pod with no role filter, so the member immediately takes a share of client traffic — serving reads from an empty keyspace, and accepting writes into a log the rest of the cluster knows nothing about. Neither self-heal trigger can see any of this: one needs a lost Pod, the other a not-ready container.

**Certain: etcd's own guard against strangers does not fire.** `EtcdServer.Process` rejects an incoming raft message whose `m.To` is not the local member ID (`cannot process message to mismatch member`) — the check that would normally fence off a member belonging to a different cluster. Because the member ID is derived deterministically and nothing about this member changed, the re-booted member's ID is *identical* to the one the surviving members still have on file, so their messages address it correctly and are admitted straight into raft. The same holds one level up for the cluster ID, so the peer transport's `X-Etcd-Cluster-ID` check passes too. The collision is what removes the loud failure.

**Not established: how long the divergence lasts.** Once those messages reach raft, the surviving leader's higher term and mismatched log should drive the member back into line — most likely via an `InstallSnapshot` that overwrites its empty state and restores the real membership and data. If so, the window is short. That is the expected behaviour rather than something observed here, and it is *not* what makes the flag wrong: a brief window is still wrong reads served to clients, and any write acknowledged in that window is silently discarded when the snapshot lands — an acknowledged-write loss, which is worse than a stale read.

The argument for `=existing` does not rest on the divergence being durable. It rests on not issuing a bootstrap instruction to a member that is not bootstrapping: `=existing` fails immediately and deterministically into a designed, tested recovery path, instead of relying on raft to repair a state the operator should never have created.

The `<namespace>-<cluster>-<uid>` token derivation does not prevent the collision, and it is worth being precise about why, because it protects against a neighbouring failure. Its randomness lives in the `EtcdCluster`'s UID, so it varies **across incarnations** — delete and recreate a same-named cluster and the token differs, which is what stops a stale PVC from the previous incarnation rejoining ([member naming](#member-naming)). A member rebooting inside *one* incarnation has the same object, hence the same UID, hence the same token; its peer URL is unchanged because it keeps its name, and its `--initial-cluster` is frozen at the bootstrap value. The token defends the boundary between clusters, not between boots.

### What is missing from memory clusters today

Two things are not auto-defaulted and matter for production memory clusters — both tracked in [issue #16](https://github.com/lllamnyp/etcd-operator/issues/16):

- **Pod anti-affinity**. Configurable via `spec.affinity` (see [Pod scheduling and additional metadata](#pod-scheduling-and-additional-metadata)) but not defaulted. Without it, scheduling can co-locate voters on one node; a single node failure then loses quorum on a 3-member cluster.
- **Container memory limits**. Without `limits.memory`, tmpfs writes count against node memory rather than the pod's cgroup and the etcd container ends up in BestEffort/Burstable QoS — first to be evicted under pressure. Set `spec.resources.limits.memory` ≥ `spec.storage.size` + ~128Mi for etcd headroom on memory-backed clusters.

The `PodDisruptionBudget` *is* auto-emitted now — see the [PodDisruptionBudget section](#poddisruptionbudget) below.

### Apiserver-enforced validation

Four CEL `x-kubernetes-validations` rules on `EtcdClusterSpec` are evaluated at admission time. **k8s 1.29+ is the safe floor**: CEL CRD validation (`CustomResourceValidationExpressions`) went GA in 1.29, and the `quantity()` extension function used by two of the rules was added in 1.28. The CEL gate was beta-on-by-default from 1.25, so 1.28 *may* work in practice — but 1.29 is the first version where both pieces are GA and the project doesn't have to chase feature-gate state across releases.

| Rule | When | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `storage.medium` immutable | UPDATE | Flipping the medium would orphan the previous PVC (or tmpfs); rolling-migrate is not implemented. |
| `replicas: 0` + `storage.medium: Memory` rejected | CREATE + UPDATE | The pause path deletes the Pod, the tmpfs evaporates, and resume would silently produce an empty data dir; etcd refuses to start. |
| `storage.size > 0` when `storage.medium: Memory` | CREATE + UPDATE | Zero `storage.size` produces an unbounded tmpfs `SizeLimit` against node memory. |
| `storage.size` cannot shrink | UPDATE | PVCs cannot shrink and tmpfs `SizeLimit` reduction does not free allocated memory. |
| `storage.storageClassName` cannot be added or removed | UPDATE | `PersistentVolumeClaim.spec.storageClassName` is immutable; honouring a mid-life add/remove would require rolling every PVC. |
| `storage.storageClassName` value immutable | UPDATE | Same reason — the StorageClass chosen at cluster creation is the only one PVCs will ever carry. |
| `tls` cannot be added or removed | UPDATE | Toggling TLS on an existing cluster is a rolling restart that has to land on the operator's etcd client and every member Pod in lockstep; not implemented. |
| `tls` subtree immutable | UPDATE | Same reason — secret-ref swaps, mTLS-flip via `operatorClientSecretRef`, peer-only ↔ both toggles are all in-place rolling changes that v1 doesn't perform. |

These rules live in the CRD itself; the apiserver enforces them with no separate webhook, no cert-manager, no extra Deployment. Errors come back as standard apiserver admission rejections (`kubectl apply` prints the rule's `message` field).

## Pod scheduling and additional metadata

Three spec fields shape where member Pods land and what metadata the operator's child objects carry. All three are latched through `status.observed` like the rest of the target spec (see [Locking pattern](#locking-pattern)) and apply **at object creation only** — the operator does not roll existing Pods or re-stamp existing objects when they change.

### `spec.affinity` and `spec.topologySpreadConstraints`

Passed through verbatim to each member Pod's `spec.affinity` / `spec.topologySpreadConstraints`. The common production use is a required pod anti-affinity keyed on the cluster label, so two voters never share a node:

```yaml
spec:
  affinity:
    podAntiAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - labelSelector:
            matchLabels:
              etcd-operator.cozystack.io/cluster: my-etcd
          topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
```

Changes take effect on newly-created members (scale-up, replacement). To apply a scheduling change to an existing cluster, delete one Pod at a time and let the operator recreate it with the new constraints.

### `spec.additionalMetadata`

Extra labels and annotations the operator merges onto **every object it creates** for the cluster: member Pods, the per-member data PVCs (`data-<member>`), the client and headless Services, the PodDisruptionBudget, and the `EtcdMember` CRs. Typical uses are backup-tool selectors on the PVCs and cost-allocation/tenancy labels across the board.

Merge semantics:

- **Operator-owned keys win.** A user-supplied key that collides with a key the operator already sets (the `app.kubernetes.io/*` set, the cluster/role labels, or any operator-set annotation) is silently ignored — the field cannot shadow the operator's own selectors or metadata. The rule holds symmetrically for labels and annotations.
- **Apply-on-create.** Objects are stamped when created; editing the field re-stamps nothing retroactively. Newly-created objects (scale-up members and their PVCs, replacements) pick up the latest latched value.
- **Latched.** A mid-flight edit only takes effect once the current `status.observed` target is reached, like every other latched field.

## etcd tuning options

`spec.options` carries the etcd server tuning flags the operator renders onto each member's command line:

```yaml
spec:
  options:
    quotaBackendBytes: 10200547328   # --quota-backend-bytes
    autoCompactionMode: periodic     # --auto-compaction-mode (periodic | revision)
    autoCompactionRetention: "5m"    # --auto-compaction-retention
    snapshotCount: 10000             # --snapshot-count (raft entries, not backups)
```

Every field is optional; an unset field emits no flag, leaving etcd's built-in default in force.

The set is deliberately **closed and typed**. The legacy aenix operator exposed `spec.options` as a free-form `map[string]string`, which let users inject arbitrary flags — including ones that conflict with flags the operator itself manages (listen URLs, initial-cluster wiring, TLS paths). This operator types exactly the keys Cozystack's etcd package actually used; a new tuning knob lands as a new typed field with validation, not via an escape hatch.

Like `spec.resources`, options are latched through `status.observed` and apply **to newly-created members only** (scale-up, replacement) — the operator does not roll existing Pods when they change. To apply a tuning change to an existing cluster, delete one Pod at a time and let the operator recreate it with the new flags. A transient mix of old- and new-flag members is harmless: these are per-member settings (backend quota, compaction cadence, raft snapshot interval), the same heterogeneity any manual rolling flag change passes through.

## Member DNS identity (adoption annotations)

The operator's headless Service (per-member DNS for peer discovery) is always named after the cluster, and every URL the operator constructs for a member — peer/client dial endpoints, `--initial-cluster`, the Pod's `spec.subdomain` — derives from that member's resolved Service name. There is **no cluster-level override**: a natively-created member always resolves under the cluster's own name.

For [in-place migration from the legacy operator](migration.md#tool-driven-in-place-migration-etcd-migrate), the migration tool stamps two **reserved annotations** on the `EtcdMember`s it creates for adopted pods — never on members the operator itself creates:

- `etcd-operator.cozystack.io/headless-service-name` — overrides the Service name that member's DNS keys off. Adopted StatefulSet pods carry an immutable subdomain of `<cluster>-headless`, so the annotation makes the operator's URL convention match the adopted pods' actual DNS exactly.
- `etcd-operator.cozystack.io/data-dir-subpath` — records where the legacy layout kept etcd's data inside the PVC (`default.etcd/`), so replacement Pods of adopted members resume from the existing data dir. The value is validated in code (a single safe path component — no `/`, no `..`) and fails closed to the volume root.

Because the operator never stamps these annotations, every rolled or replaced member comes up native, and the override **self-wipes** as the cluster rolls — once fully rolled, the cluster is indistinguishable from one created natively. `additionalMetadata` cannot set keys under the `etcd-operator.cozystack.io/` reserved prefix, so the annotations can be neither forged by a user nor inherited by operator-created members.

## TLS

`spec.tls` configures transport-layer security for the cluster's two etcd surfaces: the client API (port 2379) and the peer API (port 2380). Each subtree is independently optional — you can opt one surface into TLS without the other. The whole `tls` subtree is immutable post-create (see the validation table above): toggling TLS on an existing cluster is a rolling change that v1 doesn't perform, so the policy is delete-and-recreate.

Material can come from one of two sources per subtree, mutually exclusive:

- **BYO Secrets** — user provides `kubernetes.io/tls`-shaped Secrets and points `serverSecretRef` / `operatorClientSecretRef` / `secretRef` at them.
- **cert-manager** — user provides an Issuer or ClusterIssuer and the operator emits `cert-manager.io/v1` `Certificate` resources at reconcile time. See [cert-manager-driven TLS](#cert-manager-driven-tls) below.

### Census of certs

| Artifact | Mount / location | etcd flag | Source (BYO) | Source (cert-manager) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Server cert + key (client API) | each etcd Pod, `/etc/etcd/tls/client/{tls.crt,tls.key}` | `--cert-file`, `--key-file` | `spec.tls.client.serverSecretRef` | Secret `<cluster>-server-tls` produced by a Certificate signed by `serverIssuerRef` |
| Client trust bundle (client API) | each etcd Pod, `/etc/etcd/tls/client/ca.crt` | `--trusted-ca-file` (mTLS only) | `ca.crt` key of `serverSecretRef`'s Secret | `ca.crt` key of `<cluster>-server-tls` (the Issuer's CA cert) |
| Operator's client cert + key | operator Pod (not mounted into etcd Pods — read by the operator's etcd client) | n/a (Go `tls.Config.Certificates`) | `spec.tls.client.operatorClientSecretRef` | Secret `<cluster>-operator-client-tls` produced by a Certificate signed by `operatorClientIssuerRef` |
| Peer cert + key + trust | each etcd Pod, `/etc/etcd/tls/peer/{tls.crt,tls.key,ca.crt}` | `--peer-cert-file`, `--peer-key-file`, `--peer-trusted-ca-file` | `spec.tls.peer.secretRef` | Secret `<cluster>-peer-tls` produced by a Certificate signed by `issuerRef` |

The cluster controller propagates the per-Pod secret references (server, peer) onto each `EtcdMember` at creation, so the member controller builds Pods without re-reading the cluster spec. Operator-side material (the operator-client secret) stays on the parent cluster — the member controller fetches the cluster only when it needs an etcd client itself.

### Modes from field presence

Two boolean knobs on the client plane, each derived from which fields are populated:

- **Client TLS off** → `spec.tls.client` absent. Plaintext on 2379.
- **Server TLS only** → `serverSecretRef` set, `operatorClientSecretRef` absent. Encryption, no client identity. `serverSecretRef`'s `ca.crt` is required for the operator to verify the server.
- **Full mTLS** → both refs set. `--client-cert-auth=true` and `--trusted-ca-file` pointed at the server-secret's `ca.crt`. Operator presents its own cert when dialing.

Peer is simpler — it's a closed mesh:

- **Peer TLS off** → `spec.tls.peer` absent. Plaintext on 2380.
- **Peer TLS on** → `secretRef` set. Always mTLS (`--peer-client-cert-auth=true`); there is no useful encrypt-only mode for a symmetric peer plane.

### Constraints on the client-plane CA topology

The trust bundle in `serverSecretRef.ca.crt` is consumed twice when mTLS is on: as the operator's `RootCAs` (for verifying the server) and as etcd's `--trusted-ca-file` (for verifying incoming client certs). The trust bundle MUST therefore include both **the CA that signed the server cert** and **the CA that signed the operator-client cert**. In the common one-CA-per-cluster topology these are the same content; with two CAs on the client plane the user bundles both PEM blocks into a single `ca.crt`.

This isn't a documentation preference — etcd's grpc-gateway loopback dials its own client API and presents the **server cert as a client cert** for that self-dial. If the server's issuing CA isn't in `--trusted-ca-file`, the loopback fails chain validation and the server logs become a steady stream of `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority` errors. For the same reason the server cert MUST carry `clientAuth` in its EKU alongside `serverAuth` — Go's `crypto/tls` enforces `ExtKeyUsageClientAuth` server-side when verifying client certs.

### Peer-plane SAN constraint

The peer-plane verification in etcd does *more* than the standard Go TLS chain check: it reverse-DNS-looks-up the connecting peer's source IP and matches the resulting PTR record against the cert's DNS SANs (`client/pkg/transport/listener_tls.go`'s `checkCertSAN`). Kubernetes' DNS returns the fully-qualified `<pod>.<svc>.<ns>.svc.<cluster-domain>` form for pod IPs, so the peer cert SAN list MUST include `*.<cluster>.<ns>.svc.<cluster-domain>` (the wildcard with the cluster DNS suffix appended) in addition to `*.<cluster>.<ns>.svc`. Without the second wildcard the seed will silently EOF every incoming peer-TLS connection from a non-seed member with a hard-to-diagnose `rejected connection on peer endpoint` log line, and the new pods crashloop on `discovery failed`.

The cluster DNS suffix is environment-dependent — `cluster.local` on most upstream k8s, `cozy.local` on Cozystack — see [installation: TLS-enabled variant](installation.md#tls-enabled-variant) for how to identify it.

### Readiness probe under TLS

Every member Pod exposes a plaintext metrics listener on container port 2381 (named `metrics`) regardless of TLS state. etcd is started with `--listen-metrics-urls=http://0.0.0.0:2381`; the readiness probe targets `:2381/health` unconditionally. Bound to `0.0.0.0` rather than `localhost` because kubelet's HTTPGet probe dials the Pod IP, not loopback — a `127.0.0.1`-only listener would be unreachable from the kubelet. The same listener is what Prometheus-style scrapers (Cozystack's `VMPodScrape`, kube-prometheus's `PodMonitor`, etc.) target via the named `metrics` port. `/health` and `/metrics` are the only things exposed on this port; neither is sensitive (both are already reachable via the TLS-protected client API).

### cert-manager-driven TLS

Instead of authoring Secrets out-of-band, point each subtree at a cert-manager Issuer (or ClusterIssuer) under `spec.tls.{client,peer}.certManager`:

```yaml
spec:
  tls:
    client:
      certManager:
        serverIssuerRef:         { name: my-ca, kind: Issuer }
        operatorClientIssuerRef: { name: my-ca, kind: Issuer }   # presence ⇒ mTLS on
    peer:
      certManager:
        issuerRef: { name: my-peer-ca, kind: Issuer }
```

The cluster controller emits up to three `cert-manager.io/v1` `Certificate` resources per cluster (server, optional operator-client, peer). Each `Certificate`:

- Is owned by the `EtcdCluster` (cascading GC on cluster delete, which also GCs the resulting Secret).
- Specifies the SANs, EKUs, and `ipAddresses` etcd needs (server gets the wildcard short + FQDN, the headless and client service DNS, `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`; peer gets the wildcard short + FQDN; operator-client has no SAN).
- Writes the cert into a conventionally-named Secret (`<cluster>-server-tls`, `<cluster>-operator-client-tls`, `<cluster>-peer-tls`) which the rest of the operator consumes the same way it consumes a BYO Secret — `buildPod` and `buildOperatorTLSConfig` are source-agnostic.

The CRD shape enforces exactly one source per subtree via CEL (`secretRef` XOR `certManager`), and `tls.client.operatorClientSecretRef` cannot coexist with `tls.client.certManager` — the mTLS toggle in cert-manager mode lives at `certManager.operatorClientIssuerRef`.

**Cluster DNS suffix.** The FQDN form of the emitted SANs (`*.<cluster>.<ns>.svc.<cluster-domain>`) needs the cluster's actual DNS suffix. The operator auto-discovers it from `/etc/resolv.conf`'s `search` line at startup — covering `cluster.local`, Cozystack's `cozy.local`, and any other kubelet-injected suffix for normal cluster-pod deployments — and falls back to `cluster.local` only when auto-discovery yields nothing (hostNetwork pods, custom `dnsPolicy`). Override explicitly with `--cluster-domain=<suffix>` when neither path finds the right value. See [installation: prerequisites for cert-manager mode](installation.md#prerequisites-for-cert-manager-mode).

**Single-Issuer assumption.** In the happy path the same Issuer signs both the server cert and the operator-client cert, so the CA visible in each Secret's `ca.crt` is the same content — doubling as etcd's `--trusted-ca-file`. Splitting the two Issuers across different root CAs would require the user to ensure both root CAs reach the server's trust bundle; that case is an edge to discuss later.

**cert-manager not installed.** The operator probes the discovery API for `cert-manager.io/v1` at startup. When it isn't registered, a cluster whose `spec.tls` references `certManager` is parked at `Available=False / CertManagerNotInstalled` and the operator never touches the cert-manager.io GVK — avoiding the controller-runtime cached-client failure mode where a missing CRD traps the reflector in a permanent LIST retry. Recovery is "install cert-manager, restart the operator"; the discovery probe re-runs at every operator start.

### What the operator does NOT manage (yet)

- **Cert rotation.** cert-manager handles renewal of operator-emitted Certificates automatically (the resulting Secret gets new bytes); the operator does NOT yet watch the Secret and roll Pods. In-place rotation requires manual one-Pod-at-a-time `kubectl delete pod`.
- **Trust-bundle separate ref.** Use cases like multi-CA trust during rotation or cert-manager `trust-manager` `Bundle` resources still require a custom BYO Secret with a hand-constructed `ca.crt`. Not in the happy path.
- **SAN validation on BYO certs.** The operator does not parse the user's cert to verify SANs cover the required DNS / IP names; etcd will fail to start (or self-dial loops will spam logs) if the cert is wrong. Required SANs are listed in [`docs/installation.md`](installation.md#tls-enabled-variant).

## Authentication

Transport TLS encrypts the wire; etcd's own **authentication** layer controls *who* may talk to the store. Set `spec.auth.enabled: true` and point at a Secret holding the root credentials:

```yaml
spec:
  tls:
    client:
      serverSecretRef: { name: my-server-tls }   # required — see below
  auth:
    enabled: true
    rootCredentialsSecretRef: { name: my-etcd-root }   # required
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-etcd-root
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
stringData:
  username: root        # for consumers; the etcd user is always root
  password: <choose>
```

When enabled, the operator provisions a single `root` user — with the **`password` from the referenced Secret** — granted etcd's built-in `root` role, and runs `auth enable`, after which the client API rejects anonymous access. This is a **single-user** model at parity with the legacy operator. Per-tenant users / RBAC are out of scope for now (a future `spec.auth.users`-style extension).

Mechanics worth knowing:

- **Requires `spec.tls.client`** (CEL-enforced). Auth credentials must not cross a plaintext wire, so server-TLS is the minimum; full mTLS also satisfies it.
- **Requires `spec.auth.rootCredentialsSecretRef`** (CEL-enforced). A `kubernetes.io/basic-auth` Secret in the cluster's namespace; the operator reads its `password` key. The etcd user is always `root` (etcd requires a user named `root` to enable auth), so the Secret's `username` should be `root`.
- **Immutable post-create** (CEL), like `spec.tls`. Enabling/disabling auth on a live cluster mutates persisted data-store state in lockstep with the operator's own client; v1 punts that to delete-and-recreate. The Secret *reference* is frozen too, and **in-place password rotation is not supported** — the operator reads the password fresh on every dial, so changing the Secret's contents after auth is on would desync it from etcd. Recreate to change the password.
- **No etcd startup flag, no Pod change.** Auth is a runtime operation persisted in the data store. The operator enables it via the etcd API *after* the cluster has converged to a healthy quorum — there is nothing to add to the member command line, so `EtcdMember` and the Pod spec are untouched.
- **`status.authEnabled`** latches `true` once `auth enable` succeeds. It is the single signal every operator etcd dial consults: `false` ⇒ dial anonymously (the bootstrap window, before the cluster is up), `true` ⇒ read the Secret and present the root credentials. This is what lets the operator keep managing membership before *and* after the flip — `clientv3` attempts an `Authenticate` RPC on connect only when a username is set, which would fail until auth is on. Provisioning is idempotent: a crash between `auth enable` and the status write is recovered on the next reconcile via `AuthStatus`.

Consumers of the cluster (e.g. a Kamaji `DataStore`) can point their own `basicAuth` at the same Secret once auth is enabled.

Enabling auth on an existing cluster — or migrating from the legacy operator's implicit `root:root` — has ordering and password-matching gotchas; see [migration: root credentials](migration.md#authentication-root-credentials-are-byo-and-required).

## PodDisruptionBudget

Every `EtcdCluster` gets a per-cluster `PodDisruptionBudget` (`policy/v1`) named after the cluster. The PDB is what makes `kubectl drain` safe: it tells the apiserver "this many of my Pods may be voluntarily unavailable at once". Without it, a drain can evict more-than-quorum voters before the operator can react and the cluster loses consensus.

### Selector and budget

- **Selector**: `etcd-operator.cozystack.io/cluster=<name>, etcd-operator.cozystack.io/role=voter`. Only voting members are protected; learners can be evicted freely (a learner-only loss does not affect quorum, and the operator's existing scale-up flow will re-add a learner if the cluster was mid-promotion).
- **MinAvailable**: the quorum (`n/2 + 1`, integer-divided) of `max(votingMembers, status.observed.replicas)`. For 1 voter → 1, 3 → 2, 4 → 3, 5 → 3, 7 → 4.

Allowed disruptions = healthy voters − `minAvailable`; there is no `expectedCount` term for churn to re-base the budget against. Anchored to `max(live, target)`, the floor holds at the target's quorum while a node rotation shrinks live membership, steps down with the live count during an intentional scale-down (member removal goes through `MemberRemove`, not the eviction API, so the PDB never blocks it), and sits at the target's quorum before the cluster has reached size (bootstrap, scale-up). Whenever the cluster is below target the floor stays put while healthy voters drop, so the budget tightens with each missing voter and reaches zero once healthy voters fall to `⌊target/2⌋ + 1` — for a 3-member target that is any shortfall at all, for larger targets it takes a shortfall of more than one (target 5 with 4 healthy voters still allows 1 eviction; target 7 with 6 allows 2). Learners are outside the selector and evict freely throughout.

### Where the `role=voter` label comes from

The cluster controller is the source of truth for whether a member is a voter; it learns this from etcd's `MemberList` (specifically `IsLearner=false`). It writes `Status.IsVoter` onto each `EtcdMember`. The member controller reads `Status.IsVoter` and patches its Pod's `etcd-operator.cozystack.io/role=voter` label accordingly. The new label is visible to the PDB by the next cluster-controller reconcile after promotion — three reconcile cycles end-to-end (cluster writes `IsVoter` → member patches Pod label → cluster's next pass picks up the new voter Pod via `reconcilePDB`). The controller boundaries stay clean: the cluster controller never patches a Pod directly.

The seed is **pre-stamped** with `Status.IsVoter=true` at creation — it's never a learner, so the operator skips the round-trip and the Pod gets the role label on the very first reconcile, closing the bootstrap-window protection gap.

### Transient races

Two windows exist; both are safe:

- **Scale-up (after promote).** Etcd's `MemberList` reports N+1 voters but `Status.IsVoter` for the freshly-promoted member hasn't been patched yet, so the PDB selects only the N old voter Pods. A drain in this window could evict the unlabelled new voter (no PDB protection) — etcd is left with N voters running of N+1 registered, which an M=N+1-voter cluster (write quorum `⌊M/2⌋+1`) tolerates for any N ≥ 2. That exposure is unchanged from the old budget. The N labelled voters are protected at least as strongly as before: the floor is the quorum of the scale-up *target* (≥ N+1), so `allowed = currentHealthy - minAvailable` in this window is never more permissive than the old `(N-1)/2` budget, and is often 0.
- **Scale-down (after `MemberRemove`).** Etcd has N-1 voters but the victim's Pod is briefly Terminating. The PDB's own selector still matches the Terminating Pod, but the k8s PDB controller's `currentHealthy` counts only Pods whose `Ready` condition is `True` — once kubelet flips the Terminating Pod's `Ready` to `False` (which happens at the start of graceful shutdown, before the Pod is gone), it stops counting toward the budget's healthy total. Under `minAvailable` that is the whole story: `allowed = currentHealthy - minAvailable`, and — unlike `maxUnavailable` — there is no `expectedCount` for the disappearing member's scale subresource to shrink, so an in-flight removal consumes budget instead of refilling it.

Both windows are one reconcile cycle wide.

### What happens with zero voters

Pre-bootstrap, paused (PVC clusters at `replicas: 0`), or wedged: voter count is 0 and the operator **deletes** the PDB entirely. A PDB with zero matching Pods and a stale `minAvailable` from a prior state would mislead `kubectl get pdb`; better to leave nothing than to leave noise.

## Conditions

The cluster surfaces three conditions: `Available`, `Progressing`, `Degraded`. The interesting state space is on `Available`:

| `Available` | `Reason` | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `True` | `QuorumHealthy` | All members ready, target reached. The good state. |
| `True` | `QuorumAvailable` | More than half ready, less than all. Cluster serves; some members unhealthy. Paired with `Degraded=True/MembersUnhealthy`. |
| `True` | `ClusterDiscovered` | Bootstrap discovery just succeeded; `clusterID` latched. Transient. |
| `False` | `Paused` | `spec.replicas=0`. Message names the parked PVC if a dormant member exists, otherwise says no data was ever written. |
| `False` | `QuorumLost` | Less than half ready. Cluster cannot make progress. |
| `False` | `ClusterUnreachable` | Discovery couldn't dial etcd (DNS failure, network partition, etcd not yet listening). |
| `False` | `BootstrapFailed` | Deadline expired before `clusterID` was latched. Terminal — recovery is delete and recreate. |
| `False` | `DeadlineExceeded` | Deadline expired after bootstrap. Terminal — recovery is to edit spec. |

`Progressing` distinguishes "actively reconciling" from "we hit a wall":

| `Progressing` | `Reason` | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `True` | `InitialSnapshot` | First-reconcile token + observed latch just happened. |
| `True` | `SpecChanged` | Previous target reached; adopting the new spec. |
| `True` | `WaitingForSeed` | Bootstrap seed CR exists but its Pod hasn't been created yet. |
| `True` | `RetryAfterDeadline` | Deadline-exceeded recovery: user edited spec after a steady-state deadline. |
| `False` | `Reconciled` | At steady state with the current `observed`. |
| `False` | `Paused` | Same as Available; emitted when `desired==0`. |
| `False` | `BootstrapFailed` / `DeadlineExceeded` | Terminal states; see Available. |

`Degraded` is `True` whenever `Available=True/QuorumAvailable` (partial outage) or `Available=False/QuorumLost`. `False` in healthy or paused states. In other words, `Degraded` means "the cluster is not delivering its full intended capacity right now"; reading `Degraded` alone tells an alerting layer whether to page someone.

All conditions carry `observedGeneration` so consumers can tell whether a condition reflects the latest spec. Status writes are gated on "did anything actually change" — the operator does not bump `resourceVersion` every 30 s just because of the periodic reconcile.

### Observed member version

`spec.version` is *intent* — it pins the image tag (`v<version>`), which is also the etcd image whose `etcdutl` the restore agent runs. What etcd is **actually running** is a separate, observed fact. Once a member's Pod is Ready, the member controller reads the running version from that member's own etcd endpoint (the Maintenance `Status` RPC) and records it in `EtcdMember.status.version` (surfaced as the `Running` print column). The read is best-effort: a dial or RPC failure leaves the previous value in place and never affects `Ready` — readiness stays driven by Pod readiness and member-ID discovery alone.

When the observed version diverges from the member's intended `spec.version`, the member surfaces `VersionDrifted=True/VersionMismatch`; when they agree it is `False/VersionMatched`; when intent is not yet known (`spec.version` empty) the condition is left unset. This condition is **informational only** — the operator does not act on it (it never keys reconciliation off the observed value). It exists so intent-vs-reality drift is *detectable rather than assumed*, which is the prerequisite for safely reconsidering a per-cluster image/version override.

## Snapshots & restore

Two surfaces, one agent. The operator image doubles as a snapshot agent: `main.go` dispatches on `os.Args[1]` so `manager snapshot-agent` / `manager restore-agent` run the agent and exit, while a bare `manager` runs the controller. This keeps one binary and one image — no separate agent build — and means the agent always matches the operator it ships with.

### Snapshot (`EtcdSnapshot`)

An `EtcdSnapshot` is a one-shot record. The controller resolves `spec.clusterRef`, builds a Job (owned by the `EtcdSnapshot`, with `ttlSecondsAfterFinished` so it self-GCs, `automountServiceAccountToken: false`, and a restricted security context), and tracks `status.phase` through `Pending → Started → Complete | Failed`. The Job's Pod runs the snapshot agent, which:

1. dials the cluster's client Service — TLS material (server CA + operator-client cert) is mounted from the same Secrets the operator dials with, and when `status.authEnabled` is latched the agent authenticates as `root` using the password from `spec.auth.rootCredentialsSecretRef`;
2. streams `clientv3` `Maintenance.Snapshot` to a local file (PVC destination) or directly to S3 via the transfer manager — no local staging, multipart above the manager's 5 MiB part size — hashing (sha256) and counting bytes as it goes;
3. prints a marker line — `snapshot uploaded: uri="..." size=N sha256=<hex>` — that the controller scans out of the Pod log (via an uncached `APIReader` to find the Pod and the typed Clientset to read its log) to populate `status.artifact{uri,sizeBytes,checksum}`.

Why parse a log line rather than have the agent write status? The agent has no Kubernetes API access by design (`automountServiceAccountToken: false`), so the controller — which does — is the one that records the result. The marker is the agent→controller channel. Terminal phases are sticky: a `Complete`/`Failed` snapshot is a historical record and never re-runs.

Snapshot integrity note: a `Maintenance.Snapshot` stream carries no appended hash (unlike `etcdutl snapshot save`), so the sha256 in `status.artifact.checksum` is computed by the agent over the bytes it stored, and restore runs with `SkipHashCheck`.

### Restore (`spec.bootstrap.restore`)

Restore is a first-bootstrap-only path, not a controller that mutates a running cluster. When `spec.bootstrap.restore.source` is set, the cluster controller stamps the `RestoreSpec` onto the bootstrap **seed** `EtcdMember` (only the seed — scale-up members join the live cluster normally). The member controller's `buildPod` then prepends two init containers that share the etcd data volume: `install-tools` (operator image) copies the operator binary onto a shared volume, and `restore` runs that binary (`manager restore-agent`) — but from the **target etcd image**, so it reaches the version-matched `etcdutl` bundled there. Before etcd starts, the agent fetches the snapshot (S3 download / PVC read) and execs `etcdutl snapshot restore` into the data dir, using the seed's exact identity — member name, `--initial-cluster`, cluster token, peer URL — so etcd accepts the rebuilt data dir.

The init container is idempotent: it no-ops if the data dir already contains a `member/` directory, so Pod restarts after first boot leave live data untouched and never re-download. Because `spec.bootstrap` is CEL-immutable post-create, the restore intent can't be added to or changed on a live cluster — restore happens once, at birth, or not at all. A restored cluster gets a fresh etcd cluster ID: it is a new cluster seeded with old data, not a continuation.

The rebuild's `etcdutl` is the one bundled in the target etcd image (`v<spec.version>`), not one compiled into the operator. Since a data dir's on-disk storage format is minor-version-specific, running the `etcdutl` that ships with the very etcd that will boot on the result keeps the two in lockstep by construction — so restore works for any etcd version the operator supports, not only the operator's own minor. That lockstep is `etcdutl`↔etcd only: the snapshot's own origin version is neither recorded nor checked, so restoring a snapshot taken from a newer etcd into an older `spec.version` remains unsupported (see the [restore runbook](operations.md#restoring-a-cluster-from-a-snapshot)). The two init containers exist to bridge two distroless images that share no binaries: the etcd image has `etcdutl` but no way to copy it out, so `install-tools` brings the operator binary to the etcd image instead.

This idempotency relies on the data dir being **persistent**. Restore is therefore rejected (by CEL) together with `spec.storage.medium: Memory`: a tmpfs data dir is wiped on every Pod restart, which would defeat the `member/`-exists guard and silently re-restore the original snapshot — reverting any writes since the restore, or breaking a multi-member cluster whose other members already moved past the restored cluster ID. Restore onto memory-backed storage is unsupported; use a PVC-backed cluster.

**Restoring an auth-enabled snapshot.** A snapshot serializes the whole data store, *including etcd's auth state* (users, roles, and the auth-enabled flag). Restoring a snapshot taken while auth was on yields a seed that boots with auth already enabled — so the new `EtcdCluster` must carry a matching `spec.auth` (`enabled: true` + `rootCredentialsSecretRef`, which transitively requires `spec.tls.client`). `reconcileAuth` is built for exactly this: when `spec.auth.enabled` is set it probes `AuthStatus` first, finds auth already on, and latches `status.authEnabled` *without* re-running `UserAdd`/`AuthEnable` — so the password is never reset and the operator simply adopts the restored credentials. The catch is that those credentials must be the *original* ones: etcd stores the root password's bcrypt hash in the snapshot, so the referenced Secret's `password` must equal the password in effect when the snapshot was taken. If `spec.auth` is omitted entirely, the decoupling that makes the bootstrap window correct works against you — `status.authEnabled` never latches, every operator dial stays anonymous (`resolveEtcdCredentials` returns no creds), and the restored etcd rejects them all. Rather than loop on an opaque error, the cluster controller detects the auth-required rejection while no credentials are configured and surfaces `Available=False` / `Degraded=True` with reason `AuthRequiredNotConfigured` and an actionable message, then stops retrying (auth is immutable post-create, so no spec edit recovers it — the fix is delete-and-recreate with `spec.auth`). The operator does **not** inspect the snapshot's auth state to pre-empt this, so the [restore runbook](operations.md#restoring-a-cluster-from-a-snapshot) calls it out as the operator's responsibility.

### Intentionally out of scope: scheduling

There is no `EtcdSnapshotSchedule`. Recurring snapshots are a `CronJob` that `kubectl apply`s date-stamped `EtcdSnapshot` objects — composable with the one-shot primitive without adding a cron surface (and its timezone/missed-run/concurrency semantics) to the operator. See the [snapshot runbook](operations.md#taking-a-snapshot) and [restore runbook](operations.md#restoring-a-cluster-from-a-snapshot).

## What is not in the design

A few things that recur in similar operators but are intentionally absent here:

- **No automatic broken-member replacement for PVC clusters.** `isBroken` is a real predicate only for memory-backed members (Pod lost → memory gone → member replaced); for PVC-backed members it stays a stub. The replacement policy (corruption? irrecoverable crashloop? quorum-loss handling?) is a richer decision and not yet wired up. Broken PVC members stay broken and require an explicit user action (see [operations.md](operations.md#broken-member)).
- **No leader-aware client routing.** Each etcd-client call balanced by clientv3 lands on whatever endpoint is first responsive. Filtering to non-learner endpoints (the issue #12 fix) handles the "rpc not supported for learner" case, but heavy `MemberList` traffic can still spread across followers. A leader-aware proxy or a sidecar that intercepts apiserver→etcd traffic is the proper fix; not in scope here.
- **No multi-user / RBAC inside etcd.** Single-user `root` authentication is available via `spec.auth.enabled` (password sourced from a referenced Secret — see [Authentication](#authentication)), but per-tenant users and role-based authorization are not yet wired up — every authenticated client is `root`.

See [`What's not supported`](../README.md#whats-not-supported-yet) in the README for the running follow-up list.
