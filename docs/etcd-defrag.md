# Defragmentation (`EtcdDefrag`)

etcd never reclaims backend disk on its own: compaction frees pages logically,
but the file — and the space counted against `--quota-backend-bytes` — stays
allocated until a **defragment** returns it. `EtcdDefrag` is how you ask the
operator to do that, safely.

It is a one-shot, run-to-completion record, modeled on [`EtcdSnapshot`](concepts.md#snapshots--restore):
the operator drives it through `status.phase` and it never re-runs.

**Scheduling.** `EtcdDefrag` is the *run*; what *triggers* a run is separate.
For recurring defragmentation, [`EtcdDefragPolicy`](#recurring-runs-etcddefragpolicy)
stamps out `EtcdDefrag` objects on a cron schedule so the operator drives the
cadence itself; you can also create `EtcdDefrag` objects from outside (a
`CronJob`, a GitOps cron) if you prefer to own the schedule elsewhere.

## Why in the operator (not a bare CronJob)

A defrag briefly blocks the member it runs on, so it must be sequenced. The
operator already holds each cluster's TLS/auth material and endpoints, has the
whole-cluster view, and runs under leader election, so it can defragment members
**one at a time, followers before the leader, and only while the cluster is
healthy** — deferring rather than forcing on a degraded cluster. A detached
`CronJob` calling `etcdctl defrag` cannot make those guarantees.

## Usage

Defragment every member of a cluster once, now (`rule.all` — the explicit,
unconditional form):

```yaml
apiVersion: etcd-operator.cozystack.io/v1alpha2
kind: EtcdDefrag
metadata:
  name: etcd-now
  namespace: team-a
spec:
  clusterRef:
    name: etcd
  rule:
    all: true
```

Guarded run (skips members that aren't worth defragmenting; with
`ttlSecondsAfterFinished` the controller GCs the record an hour after it
finishes — useful for objects a scheduler stamps out):

```yaml
apiVersion: etcd-operator.cozystack.io/v1alpha2
kind: EtcdDefrag
spec:
  clusterRef:
    name: etcd
  ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 3600
  rule:
    freeSpaceAbove: 200Mi   # reclaimable (DbSize - DbSizeInUse) worth reclaiming
    quotaUsageAbove: 80%    # under quota pressure, take smaller wins too …
    minReclaim: 32Mi        # … but never a no-op defrag
```

Inspect progress and history:

```sh
kubectl get etcddefrag.etcd-operator.cozystack.io -n team-a
# NAME       CLUSTER   PHASE      DEFRAGMENTED   AGE
# etcd-now   etcd      Complete   2              5m

kubectl get etcddefrag.etcd-operator.cozystack.io etcd-now -n team-a \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.members}' | jq
```

## The rule

A defrag can only reclaim `DbSize - DbSizeInUse`, so that reclaimable amount is
the always-applied floor — this is what stops a full-but-unfragmented backend
(`DbSize ≈ DbSizeInUse` near the quota) from being defragmented over and over
for nothing.

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `all` | `false` | Defragment every member unconditionally. Mutually exclusive with the fields below. |
| `freeSpaceAbove` | `200Mi` | Defragment a member whose reclaimable space exceeds this. |
| `quotaUsageAbove` | unset | When `DbSize` exceeds this fraction of the backend quota, lower the reclaim floor to `minReclaim` so small wins are taken under pressure. |
| `minReclaim` | `32Mi` | The floor for the quota arm (only meaningful with `quotaUsageAbove`, and must not exceed `freeSpaceAbove`) — never a no-op defrag. |

An **absent `rule`** is equivalent to an empty one: the default gate
(`freeSpaceAbove: 200Mi`). Unconditional defragmentation is something you ask
for explicitly with `rule.all: true`, never something you get by leaving a key
out.

> **Compaction is a prerequisite you own.** Defrag reclaims what compaction
> freed. A cluster with no auto-compaction (`spec.options.autoCompactionMode` /
> `autoCompactionRetention`) has `DbSizeInUse ≈ DbSize` and little to reclaim.
> Set auto-compaction if you rely on defrag to hold the backend down.

## Safety model

- **One member at a time, followers before the leader**, only while the whole
  cluster is healthy. A defrag due on a not-fully-healthy cluster is **deferred**
  — the object stays `Pending` with a condition explaining why — never forced,
  so quorum is never at risk.
- **Leadership is moved off the leader before it is defragmented.** A defrag
  blocks the member it runs on, and a block outlasting the raft election timeout
  costs an election and a brief write-availability gap — the one disruption that
  doing the leader *last* does not bound. The operator hands leadership to a
  voting follower first (learners are never chosen), so the pause lands on a
  member that is no longer leading. Single-member clusters skip this, having
  nowhere to move it to. The transfer is best-effort: if it fails the leader is
  defragmented in place, which is simply the behaviour without this step, and a
  `LeadershipTransferFailed` warning event records it.
- **Serialized per cluster:** at most one `EtcdDefrag` runs against a given
  `EtcdCluster` at a time; others wait in `Pending`.
- Health is judged from more than "the member answered": a member replies to a
  local status read while partitioned or alarmed, so the gate checks that every
  desired member is present and reachable, that they agree on a single non-zero
  leader, and that no member reports a blocking alarm. A `CORRUPT` alarm blocks;
  a `NOSPACE` alarm does **not** — a backend at its quota is exactly what a defrag
  relieves, so the run is admitted and the alarm is disarmed once space has been
  reclaimed. Raft lag is not yet part of the gate.

## Status

`status.phase` moves `Pending → Running → Complete | Failed`; a `Pending` run
waiting on cluster health carries a condition saying so. `status.members[]`
records, per member (keyed by name), the role at processing time, the outcome
(`Skipped` / `Defragmented` / `Failed`), the before/after `DbSize`, and the
bytes reclaimed — the run's full history, not a single rolled-up condition.

## Timeouts and retries

Following [`EtcdSnapshot`](concepts.md#snapshots--restore) — where the Job's
deadlines are controller constants and terminal phases are sticky — this needs
no `spec` knobs:

- **Per-member timeout** bounds each `Defragment` RPC (a stop-the-world call on a
  large backend), so one wedged member can't consume the whole run; on expiry
  that member is `Failed`.
- **An overall active-deadline** bounds `Running` + waiting-while-`Pending`
  together; on expiry the run is `Failed`. This also protects the per-cluster
  serialization slot — a run stuck waiting on an unhealthy cluster can't block
  the next one forever.
- **Retry within a run:** a deferred `Pending` re-checks cluster health each pass
  up to the deadline. A failed per-member `Defragment` RPC marks that member
  `Failed` immediately, and any failed member fails the run — a partial sweep that
  reclaimed space still disarms `NOSPACE` on the way out. (Per-member RPC retry is
  a possible follow-up, not shipped here.)
- **Retry across runs:** terminal phases (`Complete`/`Failed`) are sticky — an
  `EtcdDefrag` never re-runs itself. A retry is a *new* `EtcdDefrag`: an
  [`EtcdDefragPolicy`](#recurring-runs-etcddefragpolicy) tick for periodic use, or
  a re-create for a one-shot. Each attempt is a discrete, auditable object (GC'd
  via `ttlSecondsAfterFinished`) rather than hidden retry state.

## Recurring runs (`EtcdDefragPolicy`)

`EtcdDefragPolicy` schedules `EtcdDefrag` runs on a cron cadence. Each tick
stamps a new `EtcdDefrag` — owned by the policy (so it cascades on delete) — and
the run then follows all the safety rules above. The policy only *triggers*
runs; it never defragments directly.

```yaml
apiVersion: etcd-operator.cozystack.io/v1alpha2
kind: EtcdDefragPolicy
metadata:
  name: nightly
  namespace: team-a
spec:
  clusterRef:
    name: etcd
  schedule:
    cron: "0 3 * * *"          # standard five-field cron
    timezone: Europe/Moscow    # optional IANA zone; UTC when absent
  concurrencyPolicy: Forbid    # skip a tick while a previous run is still active (default)
  ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 3600
  historyLimit: 3              # keep the last 3 finished runs
  rule:
    freeSpaceAbove: 200Mi
    quotaUsageAbove: 80%
    minReclaim: 32Mi
```

- **`schedule.cron`** is a standard five-field cron expression (descriptors like
  `@daily` are rejected). **`schedule.timezone`** is an IANA zone name it is read
  in; absent means UTC.
- **`concurrencyPolicy`** is `Forbid` (default — a tick is skipped while a
  stamped run is still active) or `Allow` (stamp anyway; `EtcdDefrag`'s own
  per-cluster serialization queues it behind the active run).
- **`suspend: true`** pauses stamping without deleting the policy. On resume the
  single most recent missed tick may be stamped (subject to
  `startingDeadlineSeconds`); earlier missed ticks are never replayed.
- **`startingDeadlineSeconds`** skips a tick that is already older than the
  deadline (e.g. after the operator was down) instead of starting it late. With
  no deadline, a backlog longer than the catch-up window parks the policy on a
  `TooManyMissedTicks` condition rather than guessing — set a deadline or check
  the clock.
- **`historyLimit`** caps retained finished runs; `ttlSecondsAfterFinished` (per
  run) is the other cleanup path.
- **`rule`** / **`ttlSecondsAfterFinished`** are copied verbatim into each
  stamped `EtcdDefrag`.

`status.lastScheduleTime` anchors the next tick (so a tick is never acted on
twice), `status.lastSuccessfulTime` records the last `Complete`, and
`status.active` lists runs still in flight.

Deleting a policy cascades to its runs. A run still `Running` when the policy is
deleted is aborted mid-sweep; if it had already reclaimed space it never disarms
a `NOSPACE` alarm, leaving the backend read-only. Suspend the policy (or delete
with `--cascade=orphan`) to let an in-flight run finish first.

**Why a policy and not a CronJob.** The safety argument above is about the
`EtcdDefrag` run; it holds whether that run is created by the operator or by a
`kubectl create` in a CronJob. What a CronJob *cannot* express is the scheduling
itself: its `concurrencyPolicy` governs overlapping Jobs, but `kubectl create`
exits in milliseconds while the defrag it asked for runs for minutes, so it can
never skip a tick because last night's sweep is still going — `EtcdDefragPolicy`
gates on `EtcdDefrag.status.phase`, the thing actually still running. A Job also
can't own the CR it created, so the CronJob route leaks `EtcdDefrag` objects;
`historyLimit` plus the owner-ref cascade close that. And it saves a
per-namespace ServiceAccount + Role granting `create` on `etcddefrags` (a
privilege better not handed to a tenant) plus a pinned kubectl image to patch.
The API is a deliberate subset of CronJob — one `historyLimit`, no `Replace`
concurrency — not a clone.

## Relationship to capacity metrics

The capacity metrics and alert rules that tell you *when* a defrag is worth
running are tracked separately (see #357); `EtcdDefrag` records sizes in its own
`status` during a run rather than as continuously-scraped gauges.

A condition-triggered mode — a policy that stamps a run when observed
fragmentation crosses a threshold, rather than on a clock — is contemplated once
those metrics land: nothing observes fragmentation between runs today, so
`schedule` is required for now. That mode would be a different feature, not a
replacement for cron, and whether the two are exclusive or combinable ("nightly,
or sooner if fragmentation trips") is left open here.
