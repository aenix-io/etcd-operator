                                            relates the key and values.

                              between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                              The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                              or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                              For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                              labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                              In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                              |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                              - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                              scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                              violate MaxSkew(1).
                              - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                              When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                              to topologies that satisfy it.

                              MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                              When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                              Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                              And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                              this value has no effect on scheduling.
                              As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                              scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                              If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                              Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                              When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.


                              For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                              labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                              | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                              |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                              The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                              In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                              because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                              it will violate MaxSkew.

                              has a toleration, are included.
                              - Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.


                              If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy.
                              This is a beta-level feature default enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag.

                              TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
                              and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
                              We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                              of pods into each bucket.
                              We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                              Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                              nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                              e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
                              And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.

                              WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy
                              the spread constraint.
                              - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                              - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                                but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                skew.
                              A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                              if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                              "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                              For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                              labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                              | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                              | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                              If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                              to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                              MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                              won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                                compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,

                                * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified.
                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                  in any namespaces.
                                (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
