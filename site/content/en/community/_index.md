## Community meetings

etcd-operator contributors and maintainers meet [online][] every week, on **Tuesday
at 5 PM** [Central Europe Time][], alternating between community meetings and issue
triage meetings. Issue triage meetings are aimed at getting through our backlog
of PRs and Issues. Triage meetings are open to any contributor; you don't have
to be a reviewer or approver to help out! They can also be a good way to get
started contributing.

For phone-in information, the date of the next meeting, and minutes from past
meetings, see [etcd-operator community meeting][meeting-doc].

## Contributing

Your contributions to etcd-operator code and documentation are welcome! If you find a
problem or would like an enhancement, create an issue -- or better yet, consider
submitting a pull request.

For etcd contribution guidelines, see [How to contribute][].
