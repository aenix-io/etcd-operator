                                dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of

                                This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified.
                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                  in any namespaces.
                                (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
